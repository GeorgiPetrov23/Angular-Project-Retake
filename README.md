# ProjectRetake

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.0.
This project's idea is to have a place where you can share recipes with other people
It has:
private part
    creating new posts
    being able to delete or edit your own posts
    being able to see your profile
public part
being able to see what other people posted

## Development server

To start the local angular server run :

ng serve

To start the local API in the "Rest-api 2" folder run: 

npm start 

Both of those servers need to be ran at the same time for the website to work
